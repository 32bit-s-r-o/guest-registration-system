# Invoice Functionality Test Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive testing performed on the invoice functionality, including the fix for the missing invoice items issue.

## Issue Identified
**Problem**: Invoice items were not being displayed on the invoice view page despite being filled in the form.

**Root Cause**: The invoice edit and new invoice templates were missing a hidden input field named `item_count` that the backend expected to process invoice items. The JavaScript managed an item count variable but did not include this field in the form submission.

## Fix Implemented
1. **Added hidden input field** in both `templates/admin/new_invoice.html` and `templates/admin/edit_invoice.html`:
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="item_count" id="item_count" value="0">
   ```

2. **Updated JavaScript** to maintain the hidden field value when items are added or removed:
   ```javascript
   function updateItemCount() {
       const itemCount = document.querySelectorAll('.invoice-item').length;
       document.getElementById('item_count').value = itemCount;
   }
   ```
